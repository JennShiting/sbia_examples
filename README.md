This repo contains the code examples for Spring Boot in Action as found on Jan. 8, 2016 from this url: https://manning-content.s3.amazonaws.com/download/2/3ca7cfb-b414-49e2-95d4-b9e4030a6fb9/sbia_examples.zip

```
Note: Even though this code was published for Spring Boot in Action, 
it does not actually match the code printed in the book.
```

Additionally, the code supplied in the book has missing pieces or simply does not work in a few cases.

As time permits, and as I learn more, I will be supplying more code examples here: [https://github.com/flyinprogrammer/sbia_the_missing_examples](https://github.com/flyinprogrammer/sbia_the_missing_examples) which will hopefully answer any questions people might have as they work through the book.
